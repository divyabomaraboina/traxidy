Business Problem 
Traxidy, a project management platform, faces several challenges in its operations: 
1. Delayed risk detection leading to project setbacks 
2. Inefficient resource allocation across global teams 
3. Limited real-time visibility into project status and progress 
4. Difficulty in accessing and interpreting project data for stakeholders 
To address these issues, Traxidy requires an integrated solution that can: 
• Predict potential risks and delays before they impact projects 
• Provide real-time insights into project status and resource utilization 
• Enable easy access to project information for stakeholders worldwide 
• Facilitate data-driven decision making for project managers 
Analytics and Visuals 
Our solution leverages several analytical techniques and visual tools to provide 
comprehensive project insights: 
1. LSTM Neural Network for Progress and Delay Prediction 
We implemented an LSTM model to forecast project progress and potential delays. The 
model takes into account historical project data, including task completion rates, resource 
allocation, and previous delays. 
Key features of the LSTM model: (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) 
• Input shape: (samples, time_steps, features) 
• Architecture: 64 LSTM units, dropout layer (0.2), 32 dense units, 2 output units 
• Training: 50 epochs, batch size of 16 
• Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) 
• Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 
The model achieved a validation loss of 0.0777 and MAE of 0.2119, indicating good 
predictive performance. 
2. Random Forest for Risk and GYR Status Prediction 
A Random Forest classifier was trained to predict risk levels and GYR status for projects. 
This model considers factors such as progress, impact, probability, and historical 
performance. 
Key features of the Random Forest model:  (Breiman, 2001) 
• Number of estimators: 100 
• Random state: 42 
• Features: progress_histories, impact, probability, score, delay_days
**Tableau Dashboard (Hastie et al., 2009) **
We created an interactive Tableau dashboard that integrates the predictive models' outputs 
with real-time project data. The dashboard includes: (Sharma et al., 2021) 
• Risk Overview: Bar chart categorizing high-risk project owners. 
• Constraints Impacted by Delays: Breakdown of delay effects on project constraints. 
• Time Trends: Visualization of task distributions over time with GYR metrics. 
• Predictive Insights: Display of LSTM and Random Forest model outputs.
